-- External Knowledge: Increase or Decrease = consumption for 2013 - consumption for 2012; Percentage of Increase = (Increase or Decrease / consumption for 2013) * 100%; Between 2012 And 2013 can be represented by Between 201201 And 201312; First 4 strings of Date represents the year.
-- Using valid SQLite and understading External Knowledge, answer the following questions for the tables provided above.
-- Which of the three segments—SME, LAM and KAM—has the biggest and lowest percentage increases in consumption paid in EUR between 2012 and 2013?
Generate the SQL after thinking step by step: 
SELECT 
----------------------------

-- RESPONSE
SELECT Segment, (SUM(Consumption) - SUM(Consumption_2012)) / SUM(Consumption) * 100 AS Percentage_Increase FROM (SELECT CustomerID, Date, Consumption, (SELECT Consumption FROM yearmonth WHERE CustomerID = customers.CustomerID AND Date = substr(yearmonth.Date, 1, 4) || '12') AS Consumption_2012 FROM customers JOIN yearmonth ON customers.CustomerID = yearmonth.CustomerID WHERE Date BETWEEN '201201' AND '201312' AND Currency = 'EUR') GROUP BY Segment ORDER BY Percentage_Increase DESC, Segment ASC LIMIT 1;
