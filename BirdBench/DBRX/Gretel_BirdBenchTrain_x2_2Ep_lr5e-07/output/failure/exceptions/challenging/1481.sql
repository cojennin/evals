-- External Knowledge: annual average consumption of customer with the lowest consumption in each segment = total consumption per year / the number of customer with lowest consumption in each segment; Difference in annual average = SME's annual average - LAM's annual average; Difference in annual average = LAM's annual average - KAM's annual average; Year 2013 can be presented as Between 201301 And 201312; First 4 strings of Date represents the year.
-- Using valid SQLite and understading External Knowledge, answer the following questions for the tables provided above.
-- What is the difference in the annual average consumption of the customers with the least amount of consumption paid in CZK for 2013 between SME and LAM, LAM and KAM, and KAM and SME?
Generate the SQL after thinking step by step: 
SELECT 
----------------------------

-- RESPONSE
SELECT 1.0 * SUM(Consumption) / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS AnnualAverage FROM yearmonth WHERE Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312' AND Segment = 'SME' AND CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM yearmonth WHERE Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312' GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING MIN(Consumption) = (SELECT MIN(Consumption) FROM yearmonth WHERE Date BETWEEN '201301' AND '201312' GROUP BY CustomerID))
